# VOTE_MINIONS
Tired of being a totalitarian dictator, i decided to give them a voting system

## TODO/Needs
Hopefully the PoC release will have a nice browser so this can be shown nicely.

* [Use POC (5) Bindings](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/PoC-5-JS-Bindings)
  for nice interface.(first basic) Maybe find some examples for comparison.

* Figure out how to deal with people without ethers. (ask Vlad Zamfir)

* Test more. Both on testnet and with readily-runnable tests.

#### Some more things

* Collecting many votes into a single small transaction?

* Limitations with regards to voting on single issues, and total saved up voting
  time?

* (eventually) identifying humans. Already can add a contract address that does
  this? Use DDOUG to allow later modification of this system, given many votes?
